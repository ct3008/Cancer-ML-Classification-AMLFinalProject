# Cancer-ML-Classification-AMLFinalProject

Finalized notebooks for Wisconsin (tabular data) and Histopathology (image data) can be found in the "Merged Notebooks" folder.

The Histopathology notebook contains our code for how we cleaned, upsampled, and split our dataset along with our code to run hyperparameter tuning and evaluation on MLP, CNN, and KNN models to find the model with the best performance for our dataset.

The Wisconsin notebook will similarly contain our code for how we cleaned, upsampled, and split our dataset and hyperparameter tuning and evaluation on Logistic Regression, SVM, Forest, XGBoost, and Ensembling models.
